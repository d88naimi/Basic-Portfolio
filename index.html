<h1 class="meMe">About Me</h1>
	<p>Grew up here in Encinitas, San Diego my whole life. I am half Persian half Mexican so I am Persiacan. I love traveling, working out, and most of all eating. I went to Cal State Fullerton with a major in Marketing. After graduation I opened a coffee kiosk at the San Diego County Fairgrounds.

		 I always enjoyed rooting my android devices and my curiosity got the best of me and wanted to learn how to code. I took a course on Java at UCSD Extension and realized how much I enjoyed programming. Here I am now taking a Web Development Program and canâ€™t wait to see what the future holds for me.
